### reverse integer
In the reverse integer coding problem, you have to accept an input and any integer that sits between the 32-bit integer values range (−2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647). 

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
output scenarios: 
```
input: 123
=> 321
input: -123
=> -321
input: 120
=> 21
input: 123456789123
=> 0
input: -123456789123
=> 0
```
